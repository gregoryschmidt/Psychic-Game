### Psychic-Game Pseudocode

1. Computer chooses a random letter.

2. User chooses a letter on keyboard. Guesses are displayed on the screen.

3. We determine if the user wins or not.
   * If user picks same letter as computer, then user wins and game resets and starts over.

   * If user picks different letter than computer, then user loses and user picks another letter.

   * User has a total of 9 guesses. Counter on screen keeps track of number of guesses left.

4. We add to their score.

   * If user wins we add one to their wins.

   * If user loses the we add one to their losses.
